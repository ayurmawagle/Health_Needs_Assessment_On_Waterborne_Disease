# A Health Needs Assessment and Community-Led Intervention to Reduce Waterborne Diseases in Rural Nepal  

### **Project Overview**  
This project examines the impact of **household water filtration and sanitation practices** on **waterborne disease prevalence** in a **hilly, rural ward of Nepal**. A **landslide destroyed the government-provided filtration facility**, leaving residents without access to clean drinking water. Using a **Health Needs Assessment** approach, this study combines **data analysis, hypothesis testing, and community engagement** to identify key risk factors and inform sustainable interventions.

### **Key Findings**  
- **Ward 5 had the highest burden of waterborne diseases**, with increased cases of **diarrhoea, typhoid, and cholera**.  
- **Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) revealed** that a lack of access to clean drinking water was the primary cause of persistent disease cases.  
- **Statistical analysis confirmed** that while household filtration was beneficial, **storage practices alone did not significantly impact disease prevalence**.  
- **Exposure to contaminated water outside the home** was identified as a major contributing factor.  

### **Study Methodology**  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Conducted in **Power BI** to visualize **disease trends, water access, and household practices**.  
2. **Quantitative Analysis & Hypothesis Testing**  
   - Conducted using **Python** to assess **associations between water treatment, storage, and disease incidence**.  
3. **Community Engagement & Qualitative Research**  
   - **Focus Group Discussions (FGDs)** with **Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHVs), ward leaders, and residents** to gain local insights.  

### **The Micro Health Project: A Targeted Health Intervention**  
Based on the findings, a **community-led intervention** was developed to promote **sustainable water safety practices**:  

- **School-Based Education**: Teachers incorporated water safety lessons into secondary school curricula, ensuring students could promote safe water habits at home.  
- **FCHV-Led Awareness Campaigns**: Female Community Health Volunteers conducted household visits, demonstrating **water purification and safe storage methods**.  
- **Community Outreach**: Public engagement through **ward meetings, radio broadcasts, and cultural gatherings** to reinforce water safety practices.  

### **Repository Contents**  
- **Google Colab Notebook**: Statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, and data visualization.  
- **Survey Dataset**: Anonymized household responses on **water use, treatment, and disease incidence**.  
- **Final Report**: Full documentation of the health needs assessment, findings, and intervention strategy.  

### **Technologies Used**  
- **Data Analysis**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy)  
- **Visualization**: Power BI  
- **Survey & Qualitative Research**: FGDs, Structured Interviews  
- **Public Health Framework**: Health Needs Assessment  

### **Next Steps**  
This project highlights the need for **continued monitoring and policy support** to ensure **sustained safe drinking water practices**. Future work includes:  
- Expanding **education initiatives** to include younger students.  
- Scaling **low-cost filtration access** for low-income households.  
- Conducting **long-term monitoring** to measure the impact of interventions.  

### **Collaboration**  
This project is open for discussions on **public health data analysis, epidemiology, and community-based interventions**. If you have experience working in similar areas or insights on improving public health interventions, feel free to connect.
